# Snowy Weather Classification using the Gaussian method
This project is to classify whether it will snow today and whether it will snow tomorrow using the Gaussian method. The dataset used contains attributes that may have factors that support knowing whether it will snow today and whether it will snow tomorrow.

## File Descriptions 
There are only one file in this repository (except the README). MCL-tubes-klasifikasi.ipynb is jupyter notebook it contains clustering the countries using K-Means. To run this project, you can download this repository and upload in Google Colab or your code editor.

## Model Descriptions
The model we use is Gaussian fromn Sklearn. With 75% training data and 25% testing data. An accuracy of 93% was obtained in predicting whether it will snow tomorrow.
